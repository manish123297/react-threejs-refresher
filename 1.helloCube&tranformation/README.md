***Every Three Js project contains four things
     1.Scene-this is the space where object is present(think it as room)
     2.Objects(Mesh)-things which we want to make(think it as anything in the room)
     3.Camera
     4.Renderer-image taken from the camera(image of anything in the room taken from the camera )
***Mesh and camera comes under the object3D class.
***scale value in mersh.when scale value will be greater then on for a particulr axis then it will expend the mesh else reduce the size about that axis
***mesh.rotate-to rotate about a particular axis (angle will be in radians,clockwise -ve and anticlockwise +ve)
***helper class is to help us identify the position of axes ,position of camera etc
